     <string name="Earthquake">If you are indoors during an earthquake

Ensure you do the following if you are indoors during an earthquake:

DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there isnâ€™t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.Do not use a doorway except if you know it is a strongly supported, load-bearing doorway and it is close to you. Many inside doorways are lightly constructed and do not offer protection.Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Do not exit a building during the shaking. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.DO NOT use the elevators.Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.

If you are outdoors during an earthquake</string>
    <string name="Volcano">Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast and lava flow.

Be aware of mudflows
The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.

Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs


Protection From Falling Ash

If you are unable to evacuate, and in order to protect yourself from falling ash, you should remain indoors with doors, windows and ventilation closed until the ash settles.

If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash.

Stay indoors until local health officials advise it is safe to go outside.
Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information.

Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.

Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses.

Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing.</string>
    <string name="Tsunami">Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately. Take your animals with you.

Move to high ground or inland and away from water immediately.

Stay away from the beach.

Never go down to the beach to watch a tsunami come in. If you can see the wave you are too close to escape it. CAUTION - If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature\'s tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately.

Save yourself - not your possessions.

Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and individuals with access or functional needs.</string>
<string name="Hurricane">Stay inside and away from windows, skylights and glass doors. Find a safe area in the home \(an interior room, a closet or bathroom on the lower level\).

If flooding threatens a home, turn off electricity at the main breaker

.If a home loses power, turn off major appliances such as the air conditioner and water heater to reduce damage.

Do not use electrical appliances, including your computer.

Do not go outside. If the eye of the storm passes over your area, there will be a short period of calm, but at the other side of the eye, the wind speed rapidly increases to hurricane force and will come from the opposite direction. Also, do not go outside to see \"what the wind feels like.\" It is too easy to be hit by flying debris.

Beware of lightning. Stay away from electrical equipment. Don\'t use the phone or take a shower during the storm.</string>
